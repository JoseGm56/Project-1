# Project-1

Group 14 (Jose Gonzalez, William Nzoiwu,  Luis Rivera) 
We wanted to focus on healthcare so our project is on how teen pregnancies are affected by school fundign. To start we want to see how pregnancies varied with in the ages of 15 to 17  and 18 to 19. We wanted to know the states that had the most school spending and the least school spending. We also want to do the same with teen birth rates per state. With this, we can see if there are any patterns between these the best-performing states and patterns with the worst-performing states. Then we want to see if there is a correlation, the data we want to use comes from the CDC and the census databases.
