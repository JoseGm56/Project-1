# Project-1

Group 14 (Jose Gonzalez, William Nzoiwu,  Luis Rivera, and Tally Trip) 
We wanted to focus on healthcare so our project is on how teen pregnancies are affected by school fundign. We want to see if there is a correlation, the data we want to use comes from the cdc and the census databases. The question we want to ask is there a correlation between public school funding and teen pregnacies, if this holds between states with similar public funding statistics, and how states with more funding allocated to education compare to states with less in terms of teen preganacies.
